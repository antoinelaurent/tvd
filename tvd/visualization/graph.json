Ser Waymar and Gared investigate the site whilst Will scouts the surrounding area. Gared finds a bloody bit of clothing on the floor. Ser Waymar asks what it is, but before he can answer a tall, shadowy figure with glowing blue eyes rises from the snow behind him and speaks with a voice like cracking ice. Gared,stunned in terrified silence, can only attempt to mouth a warning, pointing at the danger behind his fellow ranger;\u00a0Ser Waymar turns to see what is the matter and is swiftly\u00a0killed by the creature as it swings a sword at him.\n Will hears Gared\u2019s cries, but before he can respond he sees the dead wildling girl from earlier.
